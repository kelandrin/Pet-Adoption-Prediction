She was sleeping and was pretty weak as she got injured at her ear. I don't know how did she reach up there but my maid found her there. She was very scared of people and also fearful of the surrounding. We brought her to the vet and the vet told us her that she probably was caught up in some cat fight and some adult cat has torn her top ear away. She was given medication after that. She is pretty sweet but becomes protective of her food. Socializes well with other cats and I believe over time, she will become confident enough. The Rm is a temporary deposit and I will only return Rm back once you have proven me the spaying receipt for Snow White. Rm 50 is for adoption fees as I use it to help other strays also. If you would like, any amount of donation is appreciated. SPAYING is NECESSARY if you want to adopt Snow White. I will give you the contact of my vet and I will arrange the appointment if necessary.

This deposit will be refunded once the queen is spayed before it comes on heat, failing which the deposit will be forfeited.) Rescuer Note: Kittens are not ready to be neutered yet until they are 6 months old. It is very important to neuter them when they are ready, as this will prevent them from getting lost. The male cat will wander off your home to find any female cat on heat, while the female cat will wander off when on heat, and will get pregnant. Risk of losing your cat is very high if you don't neuter them. And also your cat may risk injury due to fighting or your furniture will risk damage as well, as un-neutered cats are more aggressive.",cc13183c3,8,3,2,mean,Domestic Short Hair,"Black, White"

I also trim their nails. Their fur is short but silky clean since they are not allowed outdoors. - Mr Stripey has been vaccinated on 18 October (4-in-1, RM50) with a booster vaccination on 15 November (4-in-1, RM50) at a total cost of RM. - Mr Stripey's behaviour is outgoing and affectionate. He would purr happily when held. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The adopter must be a Malaysian. However, I will consider an expatriate adopter if you can provide assurances for his future when you return to your home country. 2) He must be kept indoors at all times. 3) You should have a cat cage to confine him for the first few weeks to let him feel secure and get used to your home surroundings. 4) Neuter him when he's old enough at 8 months old. 5) Vaccinate him yearly to protect against diseases. 6) Apply spot-on medication (Revolution recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 7) The RM adoption fee must be paid in full as it will only cover his vaccination cost. Your adoption fee will help the next needy furkid. If Mr Stripey is adopted with his sibling, Mr Fiesty ( ), there would be a 50% reduction on the second adoption fee. 8) It would be appreciated if the adopter is on Facebook so that we can get pictorial updates on Mr Stripey. 9) Please adopt on a weekend as I'm working full-time on weekdays.

After a month of fostering him to ensure that he is in good health and well socialised, he is now ready to be rehomed. - He was dewormed by a vet on 21 August (RM9) & 12 September (RM6) at a total cost of RM15. - He has been treated with Frontline spray on 21 August to protect against fleas for a month. - I'm feeding him with Vetri-DMG liquid supplement at 0.5mL twice a day. - I regularly trimmed his nails, cleaned his face with a saline solution and ears with Ilium Oticlean solution. - His weight is 0.55 kg as at 12 September . - He's eating Earthborn premium dry kitten kibbles. - He drinks water from a bowl which is cleaned and refilled twice a day to condition the kitten to only take fresh water as outside contaminated water can damage his health and shorten his life. - He's toilet-trained to use the litter box and I'm using Ever Clean premium litter. - His poop is solid which is a good indication of good bowel health as well as his overall health. - He has been vaccinated on 12 September at a cost of RM50. - His behaviour is perfect as a pet as he's completely domesticated, playful, curious and affectionate. He would purr happily when held. He's friendly to other cats and kittens (but of course, they must accept him too) as he's well-socialised. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The adopter must be a Malaysian. However, I will consider an expatriate adopter if you can provide assurances for Roma's future when you return to your home country. 2) Roma must be kept indoors at all times. 3) Vaccinate him yearly to protect against diseases. 4) Apply spot-on medication (Revolution recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 5) The RM65 adoption fee must be paid in full as it will only cover the vaccination & deworming costs. Your adoption fee will help the next needy furkid. It would be appreciated if the adopter is on Facebook so that we can get pictorial updates on Roma. If possible, adopt Roma at Sunsuria Avenue (same building as Tune Hotel near Sunway Giza Mall), Kota Damansara on a weekend as I'm working on weekdays. If you're interested to adopt Roma, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate? Working/student?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets? If living with family/friends, do they agree to pets?) and your cat ownership experience. Please don't just provide a phone number because I won't call/sms and prefer to correspond by e-mail first. Looking forward to hearing from you! :)",1077fb67a,15,2,6.5,playful,Domestic Short Hair,"Golden, White"

To be honest, we have fallen a little in love with him, but we already have 2 cats and have allergies, so we can't keep him.

Otherwise we'll have to take him to Paws :( ----- Story: We found an orange tabby kitten in Damansara Utama. He was hiding from another mother cat who was being very aggressive because she was near her kittens. We think he might be looking for his mother and just went near this cat, hoping for someone to take care or sayang him. He was shivering, limping slightly and had an ear pierced with a metal wire that was already turning rusty. So kesian.. We took him to the vet, who removed the piercing because it was hurting him. Good news, only minor injuries which are now healing nicely. We also dewormed and de-flea him. He was wearing a pink tag with the name ""NUR MAISARAH"" written on it. We are looking for his owner, or someone to adopt him. Please contact us by 13 May or we'll have to send him to Paws :( Thank you!",d719027fd,9,2,6,content,Domestic Medium Hair,"Golden, White"

At the moment i am paper-training her because I am not home enough to expect her to be completely housebroken. I think Maddie may grow up to be quite a big dog so adopter should have space for her to run around in and time to take her for walks. vaccinations and spaying are compulsory for adoption. cost of these procedures to be borne by adopter. no caging, no tying up, no beating. adoption procedure for interested parties: - set up a meeting with me and maddie. - see if you and maddie get along. - i'll ask you some questions to make sure you are suitable for each other. - finally, meet up at my vet to pick up maddie and vaccinate her, then you can bring her home. interested parties can sms/call me at or Wani from MDDB at. You may also email me. serious inquiries only please. a brief introduction of yourself and a description of your experience with dogs is appreciated.",6d43edbe9,20,3,5.333333333,scared,Mixed Breed,"Black, Brown"

Like almost all cats her age, she is adept with using her litter box. She is a kitten from a community cat which I have been feeding. When she was rescued at the age of 3 months, she was underweight and hadn't yet been vaccinated and dewormed. She's now been vaccinated and dewormed, and is at a healthy weight and is an active and healthy kitten.

He took the opportunity socializing with other dogs and humans. What a day for Boy. He is still looking for adopter to provide him with a loving home. I will provide the leash, collar, food tray to successful adopter. Info on Boy : 1. He is about 1 year old Mongrel; 2. Very playful and understands basic commands; 3. Suitable as Guard Dog for the whole family; 4. Vaccinated (9 in 1) and Dewormed. Currently on monthly heartworm prescription.; 5. He loves treats very much. Not a fan of kibbles but sometimes he would still take it. He loves wet canned food and consume between 2 - 3 cans a day. My conditions : 1. I will only release Boy to adopter who can provide him a loving home. I will not release him to adopters who want him to guard factory, shops, office ect; 2. Please do not tie him up unnecessarily at home as he is used to walk/run free around my house compound; He is on leash only when I take him out for a walk; 3. Please try your best to walk him daily for his exercise; 4. Boy has been trained not to enter my house. He has been trained to stay outdoor but free to be anywhere he wants around the house compound. Therefore, please spend sometimes with him daily at least a couple of hours; 5. To continue giving him his scheduled vaccination and other normal medications prescribed for canines; 6. Last but not least, again, must provide him with a loving home. 7. Should Boy is adopted by you and later you found him not suitable or you are not able to provide him with love, please return Boy back to me. Thank you. ---------------------------------- Update 23 Oct : It has been about 1.5 months Boy has been under our care. It was really fun having him around us. We brought him to Central Park, One Utama the other day and Boy demonstrated his gentleness towards other dogs and humans who came to see him. It was a happy day for me to see Boy was enjoying his day at the Park. It is sad for me to give him away but I am not able to keep him permanently. And before Boy and I get too attached with other, I seek those who can provide Boy with a loving home to contact me asap. ----------------------- Update 17 Oct : Boy will be joining an event ""I Want To Touch a Dog"" at Central Park, One Utama on Sunday 19 October . He will be there as a Volunteer. If you're joining the event, please look up for him and say hello. Boy has now fully recovered from his injury. Boy still looking for a loving home. ----------------------- Update 6 Oct : Boy is now a ""legal"" resident. Obtained license for him at MPSJ. Now he is proud resident of Subang Jaya. Boy still looking for a loving home. ---------------------- Update 5 Oct : Boy has almost recovered from his injury and now is really playful and wonderful dog. Just brought him to the vet for a 9-in-1 vaccination today. For last couple of days he learned to play ""fetch"" and loves playing ""soccer"" with my kids. Just uploaded a new video of him playing ""fetch"" ----------------------- Playful Boy up for adoption. Very loyal and listen to your command. Give him a chance and he will be with you for life. Boy (this is what I call him) came to my house gate on Saturday morning 13 September looking scared and hungry and he was limping a bit due to swollen front left leg. I believe he had been hit by a moving vehicle or could have been hit by someone. Since I pity him, I fed him with my cat food and let him drink a lot of water. He was very cautious when I approached him. To cut long story short, he finally decided to enter my house compound and I have decided to provide him with shelter and food until he is ok or find a new home. I am not sure if he was a stray dog but he had no collar when he came to my house. I find him very gentle and too smart to be stray. he does not simply bark although the other dogs in the area are barking. Up todate he has become an excellent companion. This afternoon (Monday 22 Sep) a Vet came to my house just to check him up. Since he was afraid with the doctor, we were not able to vaccinate him. However, I have given him pills for deworming and pain killer for his swollen leg. Due to circumstances, I am not able to keep him permanently although it would be sad for me to let him go. I pray to God, a good samaritan would want to adopt him and provide him with a loving home. Please call me if you are the owner or interested to adopt or foster him.

I'm a tiny version of bacon. I wear socks. I'm scared of people too. But I will follow whatever Bacon does. I wear socks and naturally I'm an angel. I'm tiny. I might be 6 months old. More or less. I was cold one night. I don't know where mommy went. I saw a red monster. But its warm. So I snuggled in. When the monster roar I cried. Then my parents saw me and pulled me out. And thats how I ended up with them. I'm not spayed but I'm vaccined and dewormed. We are compatible together but we could live without each other as well. Let our owner know if you're interested.

So my friends and I were walking around some shop lots earlier this evening and we heard loud meowing coming from a box. To our not-so-surprise, we found a little kitty that some irresponsible nitwit had abandoned infront of phone store. The kitty is being fostered and taken good care of by a friend of mine right now, we are actually really concerned for the little one as she is only 1 week old. And yes, it's a SHE. As for now, she's weak on her limbs since she is only a week old and is without the presence of her mother. She has pretty blue eyes, in fact, that is one of the main features we noticed when we picked her up. ADOPTION IS ONLY FOR RESIDENTS IN THE PETALING JAYA/ KUALA LUMPUR AREA. WE ARE NOT ABLE TO DELIVER THE KITTEN TO ANY ADOPTERS, ADOPTION IS BY MEANS OF COLLECTION ONLY. CONDITIONS UPON ADOPTION: 1) The kitten will need to be fully taken care of because of it's dyer need of care at only 2 weeks old. 2) The kitten is to be kept INDOORS at ALL TIMES. (We do not want another case of a homeless kitten.) 3) If you were to adopt this kitten, do expect calls from us from time to time to keep up on her condition as she is still a precious fragile baby that we have been fostering. 4) If Karma cannot adapt to her surroundings, Karma needs to be re-homed as it is only in a kittens nature to find comfort in where they wish to in the absence of the parent cat, and we wished to respect that. 5) Once Karma reaches the age of 1 year, Karma will need to be neutered and vaccinated to avoid further irresponsible abandoning of kittens. 6) We will not allow Karma to be caged, kittens (at least) need to be placed in a comfy kitten litter or a box layered with towels as they are in need of warmth, without warmth, fatality is at hand. 7) Karma is still weak on her limbs, she will require kitten milk, preferably without lactose. 8) Allow Karma to walk for bout 15 minutes a day under supervision to strengthen her limbs.

It was raining and the roads were noisy and congested with rush hour traffic but little nicholas saw fit to huddle in an overflowing gutter with water gushing all over him and his eyes squinting shut against the raindrops. i stopped my car and approached him slowly not wanting to scare him.. it turns out that the little guy was practically awaiting rescue. he meowed sweetly and allowed me to pick him up with no fuss whatsoever. He was drenched and shivered pitifully but as i held him against my body for warmth he purred appreciatively. Good thing i keep cat food in my car coz this little guy has a shocking appetite!! He immediately ate with gusto, meowing to himself as he chewed and swallowed. when he emptied the container he looked at me as if to say ""is that all?"". when we arrived at my parents' condo, nicholas ate again.. and again.. then immediately latched on to my mother and followed her around. he walked when she walked and sat when she sat. he climbed up on my lap for a nap, then he climbed up on my father's lap, then he climbed up on my brother's lap. Nicholas is not shy at all!! he's super duper sweet!! He has a nice long black tail and another special feature; his right eye is half blue and half light brown. his left eye is brown. how cool is that? For adoption to a safe and loving home.

We're cooperated with some vet clinics to get discount medical fees for adopted pets. Little Pudding is looking for a home sweet home! Pudding is a cute, sweet and friendly dog, she's not those very naughty type of pup and most of the time she can play by her own and she do not really like to play with other dogs. Pudding was found days ago beside a huge rubbish bins and was hiding under an abandoned sofa, was barking fiercely to us out of fear. We heard from the residents there that she was there for three days and some kind hearted kids there offered her some foods and drinks. We strongly feel that she was being ABANDONED there as we've already spayed all the female street dogs around that area and there's no newcoming mommy dog, and Pudding stayed at that area for three days without moving to other places to look for foods (there's no coffee shop near to her) and apparently she's waiting for someone. Pudding found with lots of fleas, tangled hair and some minor wounds. We've defleas her, do her some simple grooming and treat her wound. But after fostering her for days we found a weird behavior of Pudding - she used to pee and poo inside the cage even when the door of the cage is opened and even after a long time of playing time at the garden, and she can stay really quiet inside the cage unlike other puppy who do not like to be caged. We strongly suspect again that she was being caged all the time before she was being abandoned. What kind of life she was having previously? We really can't imagine that. And so we must find a owner who really love her, and also patient enough to correct her toilet manner. Interested to adopt? Please kindly read our requirements: - No tying/caging for long period - On leash when bring her out - Keep her indoor all the time - Agree to bring her for yearly vaccination - Provide balanced meals and fresh water all the time - Allow for home visit - Love and treat her like your own precious family members Please give a home to Pudding Ì_åÈåÇ",4e290a43a,11,1,5.333333333,happy,Mixed Breed,Cream

He was trained to play rough by a muscular Judo Master. He acts like dog. Whenever he's tired or nervous, he'll start to breath fast, and stuck his tongue out, like a dog. Juliane (his owner) took Boy home for the first time, Boy barks. Later then he learns to meow. Other than Boy, there's Kate. She has nerve problem. Her brain deteriorates day by day and now Juliane focus on Kate who needs full attention. Every time Kate gets panic attack, that's when the brain will slowly damage. So the more panic attack Kate gets, the more brain damage she'll suffer. Because of Kate's condition, moreover Kate can't see other cat else she'll start to get panic, Juliane decide to put Boy for adoption. Boy is at my place (Bubu's Shelter) now. Though he's big, he's domesticate. When he bonds with you, he'll start suckle your palm. That's how he shows affection. I've train him not to play with human hands, but sometimes he does. But he's a fast learner, so if you show that you're angry when he bites your hand or feet, he'll understand his mistake and stop doing it. So whenever he's hyper, make sure you have toys for him. He has also learn how to socialize. Adopter criteria: I need someone who's confident handling him. Better with experience and someone who's responsible and committed. view video of him suckling palm:",70c811b9d,5,2,8.5,mean,Domestic Short Hair,"Black, Golden"

Both are now super active, enthusiastic over nothing and curious about everything.

They are brothers to Caramel and Muffin: And also brothers to Jellybean: It would be ideal if they could be adopted together with Jellybean because they are now very close to each other. The adoption fee is to help me cover the costs of vet visits, kitten supplements, vaccinations and the spaying of their mama cat (done on 24 Jan ) and to give your support for the CNRM/TNM efforts for community cats. Some important info: * Checked by vet and de-worm treatment was done on 6 December and 6 Jan . * Vaccinated on 20 Jan - 1st jab. * Vaccinated on 24 Feb - 2nd jab. * Next vaccination jab is on 24 March . * On 6 Jan - Cookie weighs over g and Cupcake weighs over g.

I am eager to learn and crave attention in spite of some character quirks that require patience. Please read on to understand more about me."" -------------------------------------------------------------------- Details: - Female, 10 months old, mix of Coon (father) and Ragdoll (mother). Has a beautiful white + fawn coat with blue eyes. Character: - Fayja is a very loving girl and ADORES people. She has an outgoing personality and will adjust to any situation really quick. Loves to play, play, play and hardly tires herself at every invite! She enjoys being pet, stroked and even kissed (although not a fan of being carried). She will come to you when she wants a lap to lie on (she will struggle off if made to do so). - Fayja has a tendency to get overexcited whenever she sees humans and will roll around, purr and sometimes play-bite. She knows how to inhibit herself, however and will lick you afterwards. This instant excitement is probably from her previous life mostly caged - and lack of attention. She understands a simple firm ""no"" in such circumstances. - She has a jealous streak around other cats although she is curious (big NO for kittens), will do best as a single cat. She dislikes others being stroked or pampered in her presence, will lay herself and nuzzle as close as possible to her person to prove this point. - Fayja has been vaccinated, dewormed, spayed and given Advocate spot-on. She is not at all fussy about food and is very clever with the litter box. *** Note For Potential Adopters (PLEASE READ) *** - Fayja ""nips"" as a show of affection very often, hence experienced adult owners preferred (homes with children will not be suitable). - She needs a % indoor home. NO apartments (unless you have maintained a cat-safe environment for many years). - Premium food feeding only (no Whiskas, Friskies etc). Please inquire for more info, this is for any cats long term welfare. - Small reimbursement fee will apply, please inquire. Health card will be passed to successful adopter.

She was starving and was trying to get close to any cats or humans she would see. She was in a pretty good health then we understood that she got either lost or abandoned. The vet has confirmed that she had a family before as she is behaving like a house cat: friendly, cuddly, litter-trained and responsive to contacts. We dewormed her, neutered her, treated her against fleas and we made sure she regained the weight she lost. She is really easy to handle, didnÌ_Ì_åÈt complain when the vet checked her and when giving her treatment against worms. She got a flu but she is all clear from it since a month thanks to the proper medication. She is as perfect as she can be. She has a beautiful grey-orange colour and her eyes are bright orange. A gem! She also have some Singapura features. She wonÌ_Ì_åÈt be a big cat (unless you ive her tons of food). She looooooves cuddles and to stick around her humans. Unfortunately for her, we already have 4 big cats and it is not enough attention to her taste. It is not fair for her as she is craving for attention and quality time with us. She loves cuddling up against our legs to have a nap. If you let her do it, she will spend the whole night against you and will follow you everywhere. She is not a kitten anymore but she has the same level of cuteness! We often rescue cats and find them a loving family. Sandy will probably be the most love-giving one we would have saved so far. As a cat rescuer, I will be careful to find the good match for her. She will be happy in a family, with or without other cats. We have a strict policy of NO caging. Please be aware that a cat is a long term engagement (a cat can live an average of 15 years). So if you think that Sandy is THE one, I will be happy to introduce her to you.",74d7a26bc,9,3,7,timid,Mixed Breed,Yellow

They are most delightful when all are yapping away in that lovely puppy voices of theirs. 2 others joined in on the 30 Sept.The small one with bunny tail & one eye patch together with another baby whose tail was tied with rubber band ( Cruel people tried docking its tail. It didn't dropped but turned infected with sore & maggots worms !) have gone home to a granny in Seremban on 4 Sept.The other of these 2 is an Alpha.He is just 6 weeks old but he refused to stay in cages or playpen & must run with the big boys.And that he indded does & we called him Morgan. There is another smart Alexis. She Is VERY SMART. Only 6 weeks old but learned she has GREAT magical power by pushing her snout between the playpen bars & pushed. ""By Golly., I can push this fences "". She pushes the pent to & fro to the delights of her fellow buddies this way daily. Quite a sight to behold. Come, these bunch of survivors from the construction site are some characters like their human kind. Thank God, they haven't acquire their language though. 8/9/09 Latest on our Alpha 6 wks old MORGAN Yes. 6 wks old Morgan climbed into our shallow watering bowl & stood in it to cool himself down. He immerse his tiny head into the water next & swings it about before pulling his head out.He shakes the water off next. Only then, will he climds out of the tub. My goodness, he is only 6 wks old. What will he do next ? He actually tried to steal sonme of Loke's ( ahigh ranking adult male )dinner tonight. Loke snarled aggressively & pretended to nap him ;only then did he scrurried away with a scream. Never ever have I seen such alphaness in such a tiny pup before.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS:- (1) Please DO NOT ask me what breed these are, they are stray puppies. If you want a pedigree Siberian Husky or Rottweiler, please visit your neighbourhood pet shop. (2) These are large breed dogs, they will grow into a standard size dog. They are not toy dogs, hence not suitable for those who live in an apartment/ condominium. (3) Please DO NOT delete my all these information and just forward the photos. I get too many people asking me for information which I have already given in the first place. (4) This listing is dated 2 March . This is to manage your expectations on whether the puppy you fell in love with is still available. (5) We reside in Seri Kembangan, KL, near the Astro office (there is someone at home 95% of the time). Please only contact us if you are willing to come to our house to pick the puppies up. It will also mean that we get a chance to meet the new ""owners"" to see whether they are suitable for the puppies. We want to find good homes for the puppies and ensure that they do not get kicked out into the streets once they are grown and lose their cuteness. (6) Please do not adopt the puppies from us and resale them. We have lots of contacts. If you are trying to sell these puppies, we will know & we will catch you. (7) If you and your family members are interested to adopt, please get agreement from all members before contacting us. We do not want them to get kicked out into the streets because of one of your family member dislike them. Those who are interested and agreeable to the above 7 points, please read on:- (8) The puppies are free, but as a gesture of sincerity, we hope you can donate RM50 to either SPCA or PAWS.

Not long after that, my mum was diagnosed with cervical cancer, fortunately she survived after four chemotherapy treatments. And here is my little story. Not long after I was born, I met with an accident and suffered serious concussion, I was wounded with 3 holes in my little head.. Because of that, while all my siblings started to walk I had difficulty to even stand up. In addition to that, I have blurred vision, my cranial nerves were hurt by the accident I suppose.. I have no idea when IÌ_Ì_åÈll recover, maybe it will stay like that forever. Luckily, after 2 months of medication, IÌ_Ì_åÈm able to stand and walk now, although I stumbled from time to time. My temporary caretaker has difficulty to keep for me long, I hope that I could meet with a kind master through Facebook. I know people may not like me because of my poor condition, but IÌ_Ì_åÈll pray and hope for a miracle. If you wished to make the miracle happen, please contact my temporary caretaker(Annie).

She is so friendly and loving and so unbelievably cute.

When I took her to the vet on Monday 29th May they said to wait a week to have her first vaccination, so I'm taking her back for this on Monday 5th June. She'll then need to go back for her second vaccination a month after that so if you take her before then you'll need to do this. Then of course she'll need her spaying when she's at least 6 months old, she's only 7 weeks old right now.

Everything a puppy should be. An elderly gentleman fell in love with Coops. We were worried that a puppy's exuberant energy might be too much for a senior citizen to handle but we were convinced otherwise by their devotion to each other. Unfortunately this happy ending was not meant to last forever. Coops elderly adopter can no longer cope with his strong teenage dog. We hope to find Cooper a new home with someone who will love him just as much! He is a very alert dog and knows basic commands in mandarin, cantonese, and english!! He knows how to sit, shake hands with his right paw and then his left paw. He's also housebroken and will only relieve himself during his morning and evening walks. Cooper needs a lot of exercise and space to run around in. He absolutely must NOT be tied up or caged. This would drive him crazy. He is very energetic. He also craves attention and human companionship. He'd love it if someone could play with him often. He is definitely man's best friend. Right now he weighs about 20 kilos and has been recently neutered. He is a healthy, inquisitive boy and doesn't display any aggressive behavior towards other dogs. He is eager to make friends. Cooper is an ideal companion and a great watchdog. He's very alert and will bark if a stranger approaches. Interested parties may call, sms, or email me for more information.

I love snuggling up for cuddles and belly rubs. Canine buddies make me super happy, I really love to play! Like most of my ilk, I'm a clownish doofus ready to amuse you with my silly antics. I'm potty-trained on grass when outdoors and walk nicely on a leash. Please don't tie me up or confine me unnecessarily cos I will protest rather loudly and persistently. I have a major, MAJOR oral fixation and will chew anything and everything I can get my pearly white chompers on so I hope you'll be patient with me, pretty please? Other than my penchant for destruction (my nanny calls me T-Rex, teehee!) I'm a lovely boy who'd really like a permanent home to call my own. Please drop my nanny a message and make my day!"" To summarise, my nanny says: I'm ideal for homes that... - have the time and patience to train and supervise a chew-happy pup - have one or more friendly and playful dogs to keep my jolly self company - have a decent-sized chew-proof area to contain me when unsupervised - have humans that can provide me with lots of companionship - elderly folks, work-at-home folks, kids etc. and I'll be a happy chappy! I'm NOT ideal for homes that... - cannot tolerate destructive chewing. - leave me alone for long hours. You won't like what I get up to when bored! - have small, reactive dogs or other small animals. I sometimes get overexcited during play and go into prey mode - I'd prefer to avoid hurting little creatures please :) ================================================== Conditions for adoption: 1. No unnecessary tying/caging up. 2. Maintain medical needs (vaccinations, deworming, flea/tick/heartworm prevention etc.) 3. Adoption fee of RM to cover neutering cost. 4. Allow visits in the initial stages of adoption to ensure dog is adjusting well - for this reason adopters residing in Klang Valley are strongly preferred. 5. Unconditional love :) To help determine if you and the dog you're interested in are a good fit, would appreciate it if you could email with: - A brief intro of yourself including location - Your experience with dogs if any - Your household situation (what type of home you live in i.e. landed or apartment, whether you have other family members/friends living with you etc.) - Any other pertinent info that will help match you with the right pooch :) SERIOUS ENQUIRIES ONLY. To prove that you have read and understood the listing including the information I have requested, please include this in the body of your email: ""I have read Chabee's listing properly and am fully aware of his issue with destructive chewing.

Learnt to sit in a day, wait for food in 2 days. Will poo in grass whenever possible. Excellent temperament, very manja with humans and playful with dogs. I cannot verify this but she has many markings of a Belgian Malinois and she seemed to have thick bones and might grow up to be medium sized. Had her first vaccination and deworming and is very healthy. Too young to be spayed but will subsidize cost of spaying if cost is an issue to future family. The adoption fees are largely for her vaccinations. She is very dear to us but I do not have the resources to keep another dog, hope to find her a good family who will give her love and care.

Has marbled fur and beautiful orange eyes. Father was a pure Maine Coon and mother a DLH (see final pics). Ì_åÈåÇ Surrendered to us with a rather bad fungal issue several months back which he has since fully recovered from. He is now seeking a suitable new family. Character: Ì_åÈåÇ Ferauni is a frisky boy who adores people to bits - however he will need time to adjust to both a new environment + new cats (as long as they are not aggressive). Constant attention and the presence of humans round the clock makes this process a quick one. Ì_åÈåÇ When he's not rolling on the sofas purring, acting cute or asking for belly rubs - he LOVES to play. Feather and string toys are his favourite and he has quite some speed and jumping skills to show off. He even ""coo-s"" and knows how to speak (meow) back when spoken to. Ì_åÈåÇ Ferauni loves being cuddled to sleep. He's still learning to stay put while being carried (normally jumps off) but otherwise parks himself super close to us whenever possible. He is very responsive to being called and follows us everywhere around the house. Ì_åÈåÇ Ferauni is healthy (has completed two vaccine shots + two Revolution spot on treatments, aside from his medical maintenance). He is very clever with the litter-box and not fussy at all about dry or wet food. ***[IMPORTANT] Note for potential adopters*** Ì_åãå  Ferauni must be kept % indoors for his own safety. Apartments must be cat-safe. Ì_åãå  Neutering is a MUST when he's older. There are far too many homeless kittens out on the streets. Ì_åãå  Ferauni would prefer premium food (no Whiskas, Friskies etc). Please inquire if unsure, this is for his long term welfare.

Ì_åÈåÇ I don't remember all the details, but I was a scrawny and starving kitten once, lying by a busy roadside. My foster mummy spotted and picked me up immediately (despite my hissy protests). I was wrapped up in a towel, placed in a carrier and taken for a ride. Ì_åÈåÇ Foster mummy could see that I wasn't the type to warm up easily. A single flinch from her would send me running to a corner! Still, she came to visit me for socialization several hours a day (each time bringing with her yummy bowl of tuna). It wasn't long before I decided she couldn't possibly be of any threat! Foster mummy promised that she would would make me adoptable soon, so that I could go home to a great family. Ì_åÈåÇ Three weeks into my rehabilitation, and I'm as confident and playful as any other kitten! :) I like rolling over and getting tickled around my tummy/rubbed to a purr-filled snooze. Mind you I can be an extreme cuddle-bug! I LOVE chasing string toys and anything bushy/crinkly (dusters, papers, brooms, you name it)! Ì_åÈåÇ I ADORE being around other cats too (don't care if they hiss or paw at me, I'm ready pester/follow them until my presence is accepted). The more around, the merrier! I must say I love my foster home, but it gets a little tiring having to share everything with the adult felines here! Foster mummy believes I deserve better too. If you would like to take me home, please contact my foster mummy ASAP (don't forget to read the notes below first)! :) *** PLEASE READ: Note For Adopters *** Ì_åãÌÐ Blake is not % secure yet. He dislikes any kind of hustle and bustle. For this reason, homes with active/young kids or crowded households will not be suitable. Single adopters, couples, or small families with mature children will be his best preference. :) Ì_åãÌÐ Blake would like to be kept INDOORS full-time and NEUTERED at the right age, no exceptions. There are enough street-kittens like him out there and Blake does not wish to contribute to the whole problem. ;) Ì_åãÌÐ Blake would appreciate some form of premium food (no cheap Whiskas, Friskies, etc), this is for his long-term welfare. The adoption fee listed above is to cover (only a small portion of) his medical expenses thus far. If you feel that you may be just the right person to take Blake Jr. home, please drop me an email or message at my number. Details on your past experience with cats will be much appreciated.

Be warned that she is a licker :) 2) She protectively guards the house, barking when people are near. So she makes a great guard dog/doorbell. 3) She does NOT bark all the time and annoy the neighbours 4) She is intelligent, e.g. she knew how to use my dog potty mat without any training, and will obey if you tell her to sit instead of jumping on you when you're eating. 5) She's not hyperactive but active enough that you can jog with her if you want a jogging companion. 6) Fully vaccinated, dewormed and spayed with no known health problems. However she was previously abandoned and possibly abused by her previous owner, resulting in some occasional aggression due to insecurity and fear. While she is friendly with most people and male dogs, she is occasionally (not always) aggressive when around other FEMALE DOGS, and in SMALL CONFINED SPACES or TIED UP for too long BY HERSELF. Meaning under these conditions, she might growl, snarl and in the case of female dogs, potentially fight with the other dog, but not all the time as she is usually playful with other females once she is used to them. She does NOT have this problem with male dogs and she also does NOT bite people, including children, unless you intentionally agitate her (in which case, you shouldn't be adopting a dog). So if you're an experienced dog owner with an open heart and willing to give an occasionally temperamental dog a loving home, please read on. Interested adopters should: - Be experienced in keeping dogs, as well as able to keep calm and handle somewhat aggressive dogs. Angel can easily be approached by a person she trusts and touched to calm her down as I do this often. - Preferably already have a mature and friendly MALE dog to keep her company, especially if you are frequently away. No female dog owners, for the reasons stated above. I have a male dog whom Angel gets along with perfectly fine. - Preferably have garden/porch for her to run in when you are out. Although she is used to living in a house, she will get agitated if you leave her in the house alone. She is fine if left by herself in a garden whole day or if someone or another dog is with her in the house. I'm giving Angel up not because I cannot stand her behaviour, but because I wish to do more dog rescue work which involves me temporarily keeping unfamiliar dogs, including nursing mothers, at my house, and I do not want her attacking the female dogs. Also because I may plan to move overseas in a few years and will take all my dogs, but Angel will be extremely stressed if in a plane and quarantine for a long period. Thanks for reading, and if interested to give Angel a wonderful forever home, please call Carol at. Located in Subang Jaya.",a906ff5f5,6,4,5,content,Mixed Breed,White

He will follow you around the house no matter what you are doing.

It looks to me like somebody stamped on him, whether accidentally or on purpose I don't know. He was too cute to leave sitting there. I took him to the office, and we all nurtured him back to health. For a while we thought his leg might need to be amputated, but he quickly sorted himself out, with a little help from the vet and a lot of love from everybody in the office. Now he's a healthy happy kitten, with insane amounts of energy. He's still a little bit wonky when he runs and pounces, but basically he's % tip top. He's very affectionate, loves people, hates being alone. He's a real lap cat who also loves nothing more than riding round on my shoulders, falling asleep on people and stopping us from doing work. Anything that moves is chased, he'll be a great mouse/cockroach killer. He's fun to play with. He also likes being around other cats. He can be a bit naughty, but is cute enough to get away with it, and he's only young. He's completely house trained, he uses the litter tray (he's most particular about this, was the easiest cat to train I ever had). Sadly he lives in a place of work, where we can't give him enough attention because we're all busy (basically watching him play is a massive time waster for all of us, a great excuse not to work, but). Also, since the office is empty at night he gets lonely and howls. He really needs a loving home, where he can sleep indoors where people are. I wish I could keep him, but it's not fair to Wonky. We're going to get him neutered and vaccinated this week. Please give a call if you want a loving furball in your life. Only nice people who can give him a loving home need apply. We'll want to meet you first, since we all want him to go to a safe place where he can be his crazy self.",835fdb873,9,1,5,scared,Ragamuffin,"Golden, White"

Then, her family left MalaysiaÌ_Ì__ and dropped her in our condo garage. She has been surviving there for approximately 2 years, having 4 litters. Thanks to a lot of patience, we managed to get closer, feeding her and giving her some cuddles. Last week, I finally managed to catch her to get her neutered and vaccinated. She must be around 3 or 4 years old. She is a tokinese mix breed. She has beautiful green eyes, and a black-brown fur. She is litter trained. She would need a family that has experience with cats and a lot of patience. She had to learn to survive the hard way and she is now quite suspicious of humans. But, she has shown a lot of love to us which brought the decision to try to find a family for her, to avoid releasing her. We are going to keep her one more week to give her the time to heal properly. If we found no takers by Sunday, she will be released. We are putting a lot of time and money to save the cats around our condo. To that extend, we are only considering the family who are doing no caging. Having been in the streets, she will not bear to be caged, even for the night. Moreover, we want a family that will keep her indoors at the beginning, the time that she is learning back to be a domestic cat. She will need your love and your patience in order to feel secure again. If you want to give her a new start in life, please contact me before Sunday the 22nd (April).",39c654eaa,5,3,6.333333333,mean,Mixed Breed,"Black, Brown"
